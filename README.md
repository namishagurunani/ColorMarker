   # CSS Explanation:
- h1: Applies styles to level one headings (h1). In this case, it centers the text using text-align: center.
- .container: Applies styles to elements with class "container." It sets a white background and adds padding on the top and bottom (10px) and no padding on the left and right.
- .marker: Applies styles to elements with class "marker." It sets a width of 200px, a height of 25px, and centers the element horizontally using margin: 10px auto.
- .cap: Applies styles to elements with class "cap." It sets a width of 60px and a height of 25px.
- .sleeve: Applies styles to elements with class "sleeve." It sets a width of 110px, a height of 25px, and a background color of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5), which is a semi-transparent white color.
- .cap, .sleeve: This rule groups both the "cap" and "sleeve" classes together and applies display: inline-block to make them appear side by side.
- .red: Applies styles to elements with class "red," which is the red-colored marker. It sets a background gradient using linear-gradient, with three color stops - 
   from dark brown to light red. It also adds a box shadow with a reddish tint.
